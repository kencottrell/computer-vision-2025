To configure Phyphox to send sensor data to a network service, follow these steps:
1. Create a Custom Phyphox Experiment
Use the Phyphox file format (XML) to define your experiment. You can create or edit the .phyphox file using a text editor28.
2. Define the Network Connection
Include a <network> block in your XML file. For example:
xml
<network>
    <connection interval="1" address="https://yourserver.com/api/input" id="submit" service="http/post" conversion="json" privacy="https://your-privacy-policy-url.com" autoConnect="true">
        <send id="sensorData" type="buffer">bufferName</send>
    </connection>
</network>
interval: Sets how often (in seconds) data is sent.
address: The URL of your network service.
service: Protocol used (e.g., http/post or mqtt).
send: Specifies the buffer containing sensor data24.
3. Configure Buffers
Define which sensor data to send by assigning it to buffers in your experiment configuration.
Example:
xml
<buffer id="bufferName" type="array"/>
4. Trigger Data Transmission
Use either:
The interval property for periodic transmission.
A button trigger with <trigger> in your experiment configuration23.
5. Set Up the Receiving Server
Ensure your server can handle incoming data (e.g., JSON or CSV format). Use appropriate endpoints and protocols to parse the data23.
Once configured, load the experiment into Phyphox, and it will send sensor data to the specified network service at defined intervals or based on triggers.
