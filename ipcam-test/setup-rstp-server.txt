To set up an RTSP server on your local network, you can follow these steps:
Choose an RTSP server software:
GStreamer RTSP Server is a popular open-source option
FFmpeg can also be used to create an RTSP server
Install the chosen software on your server machine.
Configure the RTSP server:
Set up the video source (e.g., webcam, video file, or network stream)
Configure the streaming parameters (codec, bitrate, resolution)
Set the RTSP URL and port (default is 554)
For GStreamer, you can use a command like this:
text
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! x264enc ! rtph264pay name=pay0 pt=96 ! udpsink host=127.0.0.1 port=5000

This creates a test video stream on localhost:5000.
Start the RTSP server:
For GStreamer: Run the gst-rtsp-server
For FFmpeg: Use the ffserver command with a configuration file
Ensure your firewall allows traffic on the RTSP port (usually 554).

Test the stream:
    Use a media player like VLC to connect to the RTSP URL
    The URL format is typically: rtsp://server_ip:port/stream_name

For security:
Set up authentication for the RTSP stream
Use RTSP over HTTPS if needed
To make it accessible on your local network:
    Ensure the server has a static local IP
    Configure your router to allow local RTSP traffic
Remember to replace the test video source with your actual video input when setting up for real use.
