To send an RTSP stream using Boto3, you can utilize Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. Here's a general approach:
Set Up Your Environment:
Ensure you have an RTSP source, such as a network camera.
Install Docker and clone the Amazon Kinesis Video Streams demos repository.
Build the Docker Image:
Navigate to the docker-rtsp directory in the cloned repository and build the Docker image using:
bash
docker build -t rtspdockertest .
Run the RTSP Example Application:
Start the Docker container with your AWS credentials and RTSP URL:
bash
docker run -it rtspdockertest /bin/bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YourAccessKeyId
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YourSecretKeyId
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=YourAWSRegion
./kvs_gstreamer_sample YourStreamName YourRtspUrl
This setup allows you to send RTSP feeds to Amazon Kinesis Video Streams, enabling real-time streaming and processing5.
