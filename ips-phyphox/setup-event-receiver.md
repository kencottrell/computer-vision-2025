1. Create a Custom Phyphox Experiment
Use the Phyphox file format (XML) to define your experiment. You can create or edit the .phyphox file using a text editor28.
2. Define the Network Connection
Include a <network> block in your XML file. For example:
xml
<network>
    <connection interval="1" address="https://yourserver.com/api/input" id="submit" service="http/post" conversion="json" privacy="https://your-privacy-policy-url.com" autoConnect="true">
        <send id="sensorData" type="buffer">bufferName</send>
    </connection>
</network>
interval: Sets how often (in seconds) data is sent.
address: The URL of your network service.
service: Protocol used (e.g., http/post or mqtt).
send: Specifies the buffer containing sensor data24.
3. Configure Buffers
Define which sensor data to send by assigning it to buffers in your experiment configuration.
Example:
xml
<buffer id="bufferName" type="array"/>
4. Trigger Data Transmission
Use either:
The interval property for periodic transmission.
A button trigger with <trigger> in your experiment configuration23.
5. Set Up the Receiving Server
Ensure your server can handle incoming data (e.g., JSON or CSV format). Use appropriate endpoints and protocols to parse the data23.
Once configured, load the experiment into Phyphox, and it will send sensor data to the specified network service at defined intervals or based on triggers.

==================

To set up a server to receive sensor data from Phyphox, follow these steps:
1. Choose a Server Framework
Use a web server capable of handling HTTP POST or GET requests, such as:
Python: Flask or FastAPI
PHP: Apache with PHP scripts
Node.js: Express.js
2. Create an Endpoint
Define an endpoint to receive data. For example, using Flask in Python:
python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/sensor-data', methods=['POST'])
def receive_data():
    data = request.json  # Parse JSON data sent by Phyphox
    print(data)          # Log or process the data
    return "Data received", 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
3. Configure Phyphox
In your custom .phyphox experiment file, define a <network> connection:
xml
<network>
    <connection address="http://<server-ip>:5000/sensor-data" service="http/post" conversion="json" interval="1">
        <send id="sensorData" type="buffer">bufferName</send>
    </connection>
</network>
Replace <server-ip> with your server's IP address.
4. Run the Server
Start your server and ensure it is reachable from the device running Phyphox (both should be on the same network unless using a public IP).
5. Test Data Flow
Load the custom experiment in Phyphox and start it. The server should log incoming data.
