Answer
Yes, you can definitely use object tracking for tracking people in a crowd. This approach is particularly useful in dense crowd scenarios where full-body tracking may be challenging. Here are some key points about using object tracking for crowd analysis:
Head tracking: In crowded scenes, tracking heads is often more effective than tracking full bodies due to occlusions. The CroHD (Crowd of Heads Dataset) was specifically created for this purpose, containing 9 sequences with over 2.2 million annotated heads across 11,463 frames3.
Advantages:
Better visibility in dense crowds
Reduced occlusion issues
More accurate for tracking individuals in high-density environments
Applications:
Crowd behavior analysis
Surveillance and security
Activity recognition
Safety planning
Pedestrian flow dynamics studies
Challenges:
Handling occlusions and detection errors in crowded scenes
Maintaining identity consistency (avoiding ID switches)
Dealing with varying crowd densities and movement patterns
Techniques:
Multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms
Using Kalman filters for motion prediction
Employing data association techniques
Implementing re-identification modules for better identity preservation
Recent advancements:
HeadHunter: A detector specifically designed for small head detection in crowded scenes3
IDEucl metric: Measures an algorithm's effectiveness in preserving unique identities over time3
Adaptive algorithms for physical distance estimation in crowds1
Datasets:
CroHD (Crowd of Heads Dataset): Specifically for head tracking in dense crowds3
Cchead: A large-scale cross-scene head tracking dataset with diverse pedestrian flows and scenes5
By focusing on head tracking and utilizing specialized datasets and algorithms, object tracking can be effectively applied to monitor and analyze crowd behavior, even in challenging high-density scenarios.
