Why can I use py but not Python?
py is itself located in C:\Windows (which is always part of the PATH ), which is why you find it. When you installed Python, you didn't check the box to add it to your PATH , which is why it isn't there. In general, it's best to use the Windows Python Launcher, py.exe anyway, so this is no big deal.
