To count the number of objects in an image using OpenCV, you can follow the detection steps and simply count the number of detected instances.


Detect Objects: As shown previously with the Haar Cascade or any other detection method.
Count: The length of the list of detections gives the count of objects.
# Continuing from the face detection example
num_faces = len(faces)
print(f"Number of faces detected: {num_faces}")
